  <h1>Information on FASTA files</h1>
  <p>
    A FASTA formatted file contain two things: a header and a sequence.<br>
    The usual file format is 70 characters long, except for the header;
    headers are identified by starting the line with a ">" (greater-than) symbol and
    contain information regarding the sequence (which animal it's from, which gene, etc.).<br>
    Some files can contain multiple sequences and are separated by the headers.<br>
    The sequence is either a nucleotide sequence or a amino acid sequence. In the example
    shown below, a nucleotide sequence is used.
